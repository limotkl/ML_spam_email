1. The accuracy on the test set for Naive Bayes algorithm.
	accuracy rate = 0.958158995816
	

2. Accuracy on the test set for the variations with stop word removal and feature selection.
	accuracy rate = 0.918410041841 after remove stopwords

	After remove stop words accuracy rate declined 
	spam rate =  0.976923076923
	ham rate =  0.951149425287
	accuracy rate =(with stopword) 0.958158995816

	spam rate =  0.984615384615
	ham rate =  0.89367816092
	accuracy rate = (without stopword)  0.918410041841
we can see that after remove stop words the ability to recognize ham email declined because stop wors are words that appear very frequently but doesn't mean anything. It appears many times in ham emails but may appear less times in spam email than ham email because in spam email there is usually no so many regular sentence so not so many stop wors, if we remove stop wors it wont effect spam email but will reduce ham email recognition rate.
